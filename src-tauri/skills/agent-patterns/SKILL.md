# Agentic Engineering

Use this skill for engineering workflows where AI agents perform most implementation work and humans enforce quality and risk controls.

## Operating Principles

1. Define completion criteria before execution.
2. Decompose work into agent-sized units.
3. Route model tiers by task complexity.
4. Measure with evals and regression checks.

## Eval-First Loop

1. Define capability eval and regression eval.
2. Run baseline and capture failure signatures.
3. Execute implementation.
4. Re-run evals and compare deltas.

## Task Decomposition

Apply the 15-minute unit rule:
- each unit should be independently verifiable
- each unit should have a single dominant risk
- each unit should expose a clear done condition

## Model Routing

- Haiku: classification, boilerplate transforms, narrow edits
- Sonnet: implementation and refactors
- Opus: architecture, root-cause analysis, multi-file invariants

## Session Strategy

- Continue session for closely-coupled units.
- Start fresh session after major phase transitions.
- Compact after milestone completion, not during active debugging.

## Review Focus for AI-Generated Code

Prioritize:
- invariants and edge cases
- error boundaries
- security and auth assumptions
- hidden coupling and rollout risk

Do not waste review cycles on style-only disagreements when automated format/lint already enforce style.

## Cost Discipline

Track per task:
- model
- token estimate
- retries
- wall-clock time
- success/failure

Escalate model tier only when lower tier fails with a clear reasoning gap.

# Agent Introspection Debugging

Use this skill when an agent run is failing repeatedly, consuming tokens without progress, looping on the same tools, or drifting away from the intended task.

This is a workflow skill, not a hidden runtime. It teaches the agent to debug itself systematically before escalating to a human.

## When to Activate

- Maximum tool call / loop-limit failures
- Repeated retries with no forward progress
- Context growth or prompt drift that starts degrading output quality
- File-system or environment state mismatch between expectation and reality
- Tool failures that are likely recoverable with diagnosis and a smaller corrective action

## Scope Boundaries

Activate this skill for:
- capturing failure state before retrying blindly
- diagnosing common agent-specific failure patterns
- applying contained recovery actions
- producing a structured human-readable debug report

Do not use this skill as the primary source for:
- feature verification after code changes; use `verification-loop`
- framework-specific debugging when a narrower ECC skill already exists
- runtime promises the current harness cannot enforce automatically

## Four-Phase Loop

### Phase 1: Failure Capture

Before trying to recover, record the failure precisely.

Capture:
- error type, message, and stack trace when available
- last meaningful tool call sequence
- what the agent was trying to do
- current context pressure: repeated prompts, oversized pasted logs, duplicated plans, or runaway notes
- current environment assumptions: cwd, branch, relevant service state, expected files

Minimum capture template:

```markdown
## Failure Capture
- Session / task:
- Goal in progress:
- Error:
- Last successful step:
- Last failed tool / command:
- Repeated pattern seen:
- Environment assumptions to verify:
```

### Phase 2: Root-Cause Diagnosis

Match the failure to a known pattern before changing anything.

| Pattern | Likely Cause | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum tool calls / repeated same command | loop or no-exit observer path | inspect the last N tool calls for repetition |
| Context overflow / degraded reasoning | unbounded notes, repeated plans, oversized logs | inspect recent context for duplication and low-signal bulk |
| `ECONNREFUSED` / timeout | service unavailable or wrong port | verify service health, URL, and port assumptions |
| `429` / quota exhaustion | retry storm or missing backoff | count repeated calls and inspect retry spacing |
| file missing after write / stale diff | race, wrong cwd, or branch drift | re-check path, cwd, git status, and actual file existence |
| tests still failing after “fix” | wrong hypothesis | isolate the exact failing test and re-derive the bug |

Diagnosis questions:
- is this a logic failure, state failure, environment failure, or policy failure?
- did the agent lose the real objective and start optimizing the wrong subtask?
- is the failure deterministic or transient?
- what is the smallest reversible action that would validate the diagnosis?

### Phase 3: Contained Recovery

Recover with the smallest action that changes the diagnosis surface.

Safe recovery actions:
- stop repeated retries and restate the hypothesis
- trim low-signal context and keep only the active goal, blockers, and evidence
- re-check the actual filesystem / branch / process state
- narrow the task to one failing command, one file, or one test
- switch from speculative reasoning to direct observation
- escalate to a human when the failure is high-risk or externally blocked

Do not claim unsupported auto-healing actions like “reset agent state” or “update harness config” unless you are actually doing them through real tools in the current environment.

Contained recovery checklist:

```markdown
## Recovery Action
- Diagnosis chosen:
- Smallest action taken:
- Why this is safe:
- What evidence would prove the fix worked:
```

### Phase 4: Introspection Report

End with a report that makes the recovery legible to the next agent or human.

```markdown
## Agent Self-Debug Report
- Session / task:
- Failure:
- Root cause:
- Recovery action:
- Result: success | partial | blocked
- Token / time burn risk:
- Follow-up needed:
- Preventive change to encode later:
```

## Recovery Heuristics

Prefer these interventions in order:

1. Restate the real objective in one sentence.
2. Verify the world state instead of trusting memory.
3. Shrink the failing scope.
4. Run one discriminating check.
5. Only then retry.

Bad pattern:
- retrying the same action three times with slightly different wording

Good pattern:
- capture failure
- classify the pattern
- run one direct check
- change the plan only if the check supports it

## Integration with ECC

- Use `verification-loop` after recovery if code was changed.
- Use `continuous-learning-v2` when the failure pattern is worth turning into an instinct or later skill.
- Use `council` when the issue is not technical failure but decision ambiguity.
- Use `workspace-surface-audit` if the failure came from conflicting local state or repo drift.

## Output Standard

When this skill is active, do not end with “I fixed it” alone.

Always provide:
- the failure pattern
- the root-cause hypothesis
- the recovery action
- the evidence that the situation is now better or still blocked

# Agent Eval Skill

A lightweight CLI tool for comparing coding agents head-to-head on reproducible tasks. Every "which coding agent is best?" comparison runs on vibes — this tool systematizes it.

## When to Activate

- Comparing coding agents (Claude Code, Aider, Codex, etc.) on your own codebase
- Measuring agent performance before adopting a new tool or model
- Running regression checks when an agent updates its model or tooling
- Producing data-backed agent selection decisions for a team

## Installation

> **Note:** Install agent-eval from its repository after reviewing the source.

## Core Concepts

### YAML Task Definitions

Define tasks declaratively. Each task specifies what to do, which files to touch, and how to judge success:

```yaml
name: add-retry-logic
description: Add exponential backoff retry to the HTTP client
repo: ./my-project
files:
  - src/http_client.py
prompt: |
  Add retry logic with exponential backoff to all HTTP requests.
  Max 3 retries. Initial delay 1s, max delay 30s.
judge:
  - type: pytest
    command: pytest tests/test_http_client.py -v
  - type: grep
    pattern: "exponential_backoff|retry"
    files: src/http_client.py
commit: "abc1234"  # pin to specific commit for reproducibility
```

### Git Worktree Isolation

Each agent run gets its own git worktree — no Docker required. This provides reproducibility isolation so agents cannot interfere with each other or corrupt the base repo.

### Metrics Collected

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| Pass rate | Did the agent produce code that passes the judge? |
| Cost | API spend per task (when available) |
| Time | Wall-clock seconds to completion |
| Consistency | Pass rate across repeated runs (e.g., 3/3 = 100%) |

## Workflow

### 1. Define Tasks

Create a `tasks/` directory with YAML files, one per task:

```bash
mkdir tasks
# Write task definitions (see template above)
```

### 2. Run Agents

Execute agents against your tasks:

```bash
agent-eval run --task tasks/add-retry-logic.yaml --agent claude-code --agent aider --runs 3
```

Each run:
1. Creates a fresh git worktree from the specified commit
2. Hands the prompt to the agent
3. Runs the judge criteria
4. Records pass/fail, cost, and time

### 3. Compare Results

Generate a comparison report:

```bash
agent-eval report --format table
```

```
Task: add-retry-logic (3 runs each)
┌──────────────┬───────────┬────────┬────────┬─────────────┐
│ Agent        │ Pass Rate │ Cost   │ Time   │ Consistency │
├──────────────┼───────────┼────────┼────────┼─────────────┤
│ claude-code  │ 3/3       │ $0.12  │ 45s    │ 100%        │
│ aider        │ 2/3       │ $0.08  │ 38s    │  67%        │
└──────────────┴───────────┴────────┴────────┴─────────────┘
```

## Judge Types

### Code-Based (deterministic)

```yaml
judge:
  - type: pytest
    command: pytest tests/ -v
  - type: command
    command: npm run build
```

### Pattern-Based

```yaml
judge:
  - type: grep
    pattern: "class.*Retry"
    files: src/**/*.py
```

### Model-Based (LLM-as-judge)

```yaml
judge:
  - type: llm
    prompt: |
      Does this implementation correctly handle exponential backoff?
      Check for: max retries, increasing delays, jitter.
```

## Best Practices

- **Start with 3-5 tasks** that represent your real workload, not toy examples
- **Run at least 3 trials** per agent to capture variance — agents are non-deterministic
- **Pin the commit** in your task YAML so results are reproducible across days/weeks
- **Include at least one deterministic judge** (tests, build) per task — LLM judges add noise
- **Track cost alongside pass rate** — a 95% agent at 10x the cost may not be the right choice
- **Version your task definitions** — they are test fixtures, treat them as code

# Agent Harness Construction

Use this skill when you are improving how an agent plans, calls tools, recovers from errors, and converges on completion.

## Core Model

Agent output quality is constrained by:
1. Action space quality
2. Observation quality
3. Recovery quality
4. Context budget quality

## Action Space Design

1. Use stable, explicit tool names.
2. Keep inputs schema-first and narrow.
3. Return deterministic output shapes.
4. Avoid catch-all tools unless isolation is impossible.

## Granularity Rules

- Use micro-tools for high-risk operations (deploy, migration, permissions).
- Use medium tools for common edit/read/search loops.
- Use macro-tools only when round-trip overhead is the dominant cost.

## Observation Design

Every tool response should include:
- `status`: success|warning|error
- `summary`: one-line result
- `next_actions`: actionable follow-ups
- `artifacts`: file paths / IDs

## Error Recovery Contract

For every error path, include:
- root cause hint
- safe retry instruction
- explicit stop condition

## Context Budgeting

1. Keep system prompt minimal and invariant.
2. Move large guidance into skills loaded on demand.
3. Prefer references to files over inlining long documents.
4. Compact at phase boundaries, not arbitrary token thresholds.

## Architecture Pattern Guidance

- ReAct: best for exploratory tasks with uncertain path.
- Function-calling: best for structured deterministic flows.
- Hybrid (recommended): ReAct planning + typed tool execution.

## Benchmarking

Track:
- completion rate
- retries per task
- pass@1 and pass@3
- cost per successful task

## Anti-Patterns

- Too many tools with overlapping semantics.
- Opaque tool output with no recovery hints.
- Error-only output without next steps.
- Context overloading with irrelevant references.

name: agent-sort
description: Build an evidence-backed ECC install plan for a specific repo by sorting skills, commands, rules, hooks, and extras into DAILY vs LIBRARY buckets using parallel repo-aware review passes. Use when ECC should be trimmed to what a project actually needs instead of loading the full bundle.
origin: ECC
---

# Agent Sort

Use this skill when a repo needs a project-specific ECC surface instead of the default full install.

The goal is not to guess what "feels useful." The goal is to classify ECC components with evidence from the actual codebase.

## When to Use

- A project only needs a subset of ECC and full installs are too noisy
- The repo stack is clear, but nobody wants to hand-curate skills one by one
- A team wants a repeatable install decision backed by grep evidence instead of opinion
- You need to separate always-loaded daily workflow surfaces from searchable library/reference surfaces
- A repo has drifted into the wrong language, rule, or hook set and needs cleanup

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Use the current repository as the source of truth, not generic preferences
- Every DAILY decision must cite concrete repo evidence
- LIBRARY does not mean "delete"; it means "keep accessible without loading by default"
- Do not install hooks, rules, or scripts that the current repo cannot use
- Prefer ECC-native surfaces; do not introduce a second install system

## Outputs

Produce these artifacts in order:

1. DAILY inventory
2. LIBRARY inventory
3. install plan
4. verification report
5. optional `skill-library` router if the project wants one

## Classification Model

Use two buckets only:

- `DAILY`
  - should load every session for this repo
  - strongly matched to the repo's language, framework, workflow, or operator surface
- `LIBRARY`
  - useful to retain, but not worth loading by default
  - should remain reachable through search, router skill, or selective manual use

## Evidence Sources

Use repo-local evidence before making any classification:

- file extensions
- package managers and lockfiles
- framework configs
- CI and hook configs
- build/test scripts
- imports and dependency manifests
- repo docs that explicitly describe the stack

Useful commands include:

```bash
rg --files
rg -n "typescript|react|next|supabase|django|spring|flutter|swift"
cat package.json
cat pyproject.toml
cat Cargo.toml
cat pubspec.yaml
cat go.mod
```

## Parallel Review Passes

If parallel subagents are available, split the review into these passes:

1. Agents
   - classify `agents/*`
2. Skills
   - classify `skills/*`
3. Commands
   - classify `commands/*`
4. Rules
   - classify `rules/*`
5. Hooks and scripts
   - classify hook surfaces, MCP health checks, helper scripts, and OS compatibility
6. Extras
   - classify contexts, examples, MCP configs, templates, and guidance docs

If subagents are not available, run the same passes sequentially.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Read the repo

Establish the real stack before classifying anything:

- languages in use
- frameworks in use
- primary package manager
- test stack
- lint/format stack
- deployment/runtime surface
- operator integrations already present

### 2. Build the evidence table

For every candidate surface, record:

- component path
- component type
- proposed bucket
- repo evidence
- short justification

Use this format:

```text
skills/frontend-patterns | skill | DAILY | 84 .tsx files, next.config.ts present | core frontend stack
skills/django-patterns   | skill | LIBRARY | no .py files, no pyproject.toml       | not active in this repo
rules/typescript/*       | rules | DAILY | package.json + tsconfig.json            | active TS repo
rules/python/*           | rules | LIBRARY | zero Python source files             | keep accessible only
```

### 3. Decide DAILY vs LIBRARY

Promote to `DAILY` when:

- the repo clearly uses the matching stack
- the component is general enough to help every session
- the repo already depends on the corresponding runtime or workflow

Demote to `LIBRARY` when:

- the component is off-stack
- the repo might need it later, but not every day
- it adds context overhead without immediate relevance

### 4. Build the install plan

Translate the classification into action:

- DAILY skills -> install or keep in `.claude/skills/`
- DAILY commands -> keep as explicit shims only if still useful
- DAILY rules -> install only matching language sets
- DAILY hooks/scripts -> keep only compatible ones
- LIBRARY surfaces -> keep accessible through search or `skill-library`

If the repo already uses selective installs, update that plan instead of creating another system.

### 5. Create the optional library router

If the project wants a searchable library surface, create:

- `.claude/skills/skill-library/SKILL.md`

That router should contain:

- a short explanation of DAILY vs LIBRARY
- grouped trigger keywords
- where the library references live

Do not duplicate every skill body inside the router.

### 6. Verify the result

After the plan is applied, verify:

- every DAILY file exists where expected
- stale language rules were not left active
- incompatible hooks were not installed
- the resulting install actually matches the repo stack

Return a compact report with:

- DAILY count
- LIBRARY count
- removed stale surfaces
- open questions

## Handoffs

If the next step is interactive installation or repair, hand off to:

- `configure-ecc`

If the next step is overlap cleanup or catalog review, hand off to:

- `skill-stocktake`

If the next step is broader context trimming, hand off to:

- `strategic-compact`

## Output Format

Return the result in this order:

```text
STACK
- language/framework/runtime summary

DAILY
- always-loaded items with evidence

LIBRARY
- searchable/reference items with evidence

INSTALL PLAN
- what should be installed, removed, or routed

VERIFICATION
- checks run and remaining gaps
```
